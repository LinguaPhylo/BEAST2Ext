# BEAST2 Outer Core (Deprecated)

[![Build Status](https://github.com/LinguaPhylo/beast-outercore/workflows/outercore%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LinguaPhylo/beast-outercore/actions?query=workflow%3A%22outercore+tests%22)

**All classes have moved to BEAST 2 (>= v2.6.6) and BEASTLabs (>= v1.9.7).**


The `outercore` package of BEAST 2 has core features, not in the core :)

It is also released as a BEAST 2 package. 
How to install and use BEAST 2 packages can be seen 
[here](https://www.beast2.org/managing-packages/). 

This project requires Java 1.8.
